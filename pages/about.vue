          Im Eric, and I have been programming and developing for almost 2 years
          now. I am a huge fan of Vue.js and Nuxt.js and they have spent a lot
          of time developing small applications with those frameworks.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am very passionate about coding, designing and programming various things.
          I have spent a lot of time perfecting my craft and am very dedicated to what I do.

        <h1 class="title pt-1 pb-1">My Setup</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>AMD Athlon 3000G Mini ITX PC with Pop!_OS 20.04 LTS</strong></li>
            <p>
              This little CPU might seem underpowered but it really gets the job done on a budget
            </p>

            <li><strong>Lenovo Legion i7-9750H Laptop with Pop!_OS 20.04 LTS with Windows 10 Pro Edition dual boot</strong></li>
            <p>
              Every developer needs a good laptop!
            </p>

            <li><strong>Visual Studio Code with Perty UI Theme</strong></li>
            <p>
              I could list many positive things about Visual Studio Code. I recommend checking out this
              editor theme called Perty <a href="#">here</a>
            </p>

            <li><strong>Vue.js and Nuxt.js Javascript frameworks for front-end development</strong></li>
            <p>
              Really easy to learn and pick up, Vue.js and Nuxt.js are my absolute favorite frameworks to use
              for developing my front-end solutions. I really enjoy the approach Vue.js takes
              and the community based approach it takes. Something about this framework drew me in, and I have spent
              majority of my time using them. Shout outs to React and Svelte!
            </p>

            <li><strong>Bulma and Buefy with some Sass for styling components and content</strong></li>
            <p>
              I originally started out using Bootstrap to mock up little components I wanted to make,
              or to primarily style all my content. Over time I stumbled upon Bulma and fell in love with it simplicity.
              Spending a lot of time working and reading the Bulma documents I prefer it over other CSS frameworks.
              If your developing with Vue I recommend checking out a Buefy it's based off Bulma!
            </p>

            <li><strong>A little Node.js, some Express paired with MongoDB or good old Firebase</strong></li>
            <p>
              For the back-end I prefer using Javascript for everything if I can.
              I originally went to College for general computer programming and learned a lot of Java and Python in the past.
              When it comes to designing my personal projects I prefer Javascript for everything.
              I have spent a lot of time making small applications using MongoDB and Google's Firebase and 
              can't find anything bad to say about those services and documentation that is availible to learn.
            </p>

            <li><strong>When it comes to deploying applications, check Netlify, Vercel and Heroku</strong></li>
            <p>
              They're tonns of different methods to deploying an application, website, whatever it might be.
              At this time being I enjoy messing around with Netlify, Vercel and Heroku. 
            </p>

            <li><strong>Version and Source control, Git and Github</strong></li>
            <p>
              I honestly don't think I could live without. Prefer Github over
              Bitbucket and Gitlab, just a personal prefernce
            </p>

            <li><strong>Linux and Pop!_OS for everything</strong></li>
            <p>
              Spending the last 2 years using different distribution versions of Linux
              such as: Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch, Manjaro and many others I find Pop!_OS to 
              have everything I need to get the jobs done. Its super easy to get installed 
              and running, requires minimal effort to setup and is stable. Stability is import to me when
              I am working.
